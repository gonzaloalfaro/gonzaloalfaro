Hi there. üëã I'm a Digital Product Consultant, and I'm absolutely in love with bringing design and technology together to create experiences that really matter. I love working on product and web development projects, exploring AI tools and the cloud, and sharing my journey in digital innovation.

üõ†Ô∏è Right now, I'm having a blast exploring AI tools like CrewAI and building super innovative projects with Astro, Strapi, and AWS.
